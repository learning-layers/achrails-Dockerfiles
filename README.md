# achrails-Dockerfiles

Here are Dockerfiles for creating achrails-server inside Layers Box.

This will create 2 containers, where one has achrails running on Ruby on Rails and the other has postgres database that achrails will use. 

The environment configuration should come from common.env (from LayersBox, not here) and achrails.env (here), but what goes there and how the configuration is written there is still open.
